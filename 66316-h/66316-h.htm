<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are many fishes in the Sea,&rdquo; in fact so many that it is possible to
have a different kind served every day of the year, and still not exhaust the
variety, but it is necessary to the attainment of this result to have the resources
of a great city fish market at one&rsquo;s command. Thanks to the skill of the
trained cook there are an infinite number of ways in which the commoner sort
of fish that are to be had everywhere, can be transformed into a great variety
of dainty, yet simple and inexpensive dishes. And here is the value of this
publication.</p>
<p>Cook books there are of all sorts and shapes, but strange to say the subject
of Fish Cookery has been sadly neglected in all of them, and to supply this deficiency,
the following collection of receipts has been carefully gathered and
properly arranged for the convenience of the housewife, no time or expense
having been spared to make the volume a thoroughly reliable and practical
guide upon the important subject which it treats.</p>
<p>The experience of distinguished chefs and epicures of many lands have been
fully drawn upon, while noted travellers, anglers, and sportsmen, who have
been pleased with the cookery of some famous guide or cook, have revealed
his secrets for the benefit of our readers. The famous housekeepers have assisted,
too, and have contributed generously from the wealth of their experience.
In addition to the receipts there will be found within the covers of the
book much other information of value to the reader, about the best fish foods,
where obtained and how to be made of the best service. It is in every way a
complete guide to the culinary art as applied to the fish family.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CARE IN THE COOKROOM.</span>
<br />Importance of Selecting the Best in the Line of Food Supplies.</h2>
<p>Housekeepers throughout the land are every day becoming better informed
regarding the relative quality of articles of food offered in the markets,
and the tradesman who does not cater to this growing knowledge will
soon lose the patronage of his best customers. People of intelligence now
demand the best in food products, and the essential features of superiority
insisted upon are palatableness, purity and wholesomeness. These qualities
must unite in order that the stamp of approval may be bestowed, and a
product lacking any one of these cardinal requirements cannot hope for lasting
success. Upon the other hand, when any article of food supply has
demonstrated that it not only pleases the taste, but is also nutritious and in
every way conducive to health, the popularity of such product is assured.</p>
<p>An illustration of the preceding statement is happily furnished in the
pronounced popularity of &ldquo;Gold Wedge&rdquo; Brand of Fibered Codfish, a product
absolutely without odor, and requiring no boiling or soaking, which
must be conceded a place of pre-eminence among the food products of unquestioned
value now being offered. That this article possesses all the necessary
qualifications for its acceptance by the most keenly critical and discriminating
housekeeper has been so frequently and so thoroughly demonstrated
that it is scarcely worth while to more than allude to such fact. That
it has attained to the highest place in the confidence of consumers is ample
proof of its superiority. The cardinal virtues of Palatableness, Purity and
Wholesomeness have rendered &ldquo;Gold Wedge&rdquo; Brand of Fibered Codfish a
favored article of food in refined and intelligent homes, and caused it to be
regarded as a necessary part of the menu.</p>
<p>Wherever unquestioned worth in any food article is amply proved it is
the duty of the physician to bestow his commendation, and hygienic publications
should be foremost in extending their meed of praise, for to these
two sources the general public must ever look for unbiased and competent
advice upon all matters pertaining to the health and well-being of the people;
it is, therefore, with more than ordinary pleasure that we bear testimony to
the appetizing and wholesome qualities of &ldquo;Gold Wedge&rdquo; Brand of Fibered
Codfish, which is in all respects worthy of highest praise.</p>
<p>The manufacturers of this superior food product, Shute &amp; Merchant,
Gloucester, Mass., are of such standing commercially that their brand is indicative
of merit; and we feel no hesitancy in bestowing heartiest approval
upon their wares. To those of our readers who have written us concerning
this product, and to others who may not be fully conversant with the high
qualities of the same, we would say that &ldquo;Gold Wedge&rdquo; Brand of Fibered
Codfish is all that could be desired, and that it should find a place upon every
table where the laws of health, as well as the gratification of the appetite,
receive the proper consideration. Any first-class dealer will supply this
article if insisted upon, and those catering to refined patronage will see the
necessity of keeping it in stock.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</span></h2>
<p>To economize space and avoid much unnecessary repetition, we herewith
append such directions for the treatment of fish preparatory to cooking as admit
of general application.</p>
<p><span id="n1" class="ss">No. 1. When a Fish is Fresh.</span>&mdash;When the
gills of a fish are of a bright color, and
the eyes appear full and clear, it is quite
fresh; if the flesh seems hard and firm
and rises quickly from pressure with
the finger, its freshness is still farther
assured. Although a fish that will not
stand these tests may not be spoilt, its
goodness has deteriorated in proportion
as it fails to meet such requirements,
and it is so much less desirable for the
table. The sense of smell cannot be
relied upon to decide the question of
freshness.</p>
<p><span id="n2" class="ss">No. 2. To Dress or Clean a Fish.</span>&mdash;Some
fish require scaling and some need to
be skinned before cooking. The sooner
a fish is scaled after taking from the
water, the easier it can be done. Some
fish of the scaly variety, however,
should never be scaled as the scales of
such are esteemed a delicacy. Such
exceptions will be noted in the recipes
for cooking these fish. When the scales
of a fish have become dry and hard or
the fish is a difficult one to scale from
any cause, it should be soaked for a
while in cold salted water. If you have
not time to do this, hold the fish up by
the tail and pour boiling water over it,
but do not let it lie in hot water for an
instant. Having scaled the fish, the
next question is how is it to be cooked?
for this has much to do with the dressing
process.</p>
<p><span id="n3" class="ss">No. 3. To prepare for Baking or Boiling.</span>&mdash;If
the fish is a large one and to be
cooked whole, it should be opened from
the vent up as far as the ventral fins,&mdash;taking
care not to mutilate the roes or
livers if they are wanted for cooking.
With a sharp knife separate the intestines
from the body, also the gills from
the head, and pull out all together
through the natural gill opening. The
reason for opening the fish as little as
possible, is to keep it in best possible
shape for stuffing, but if no stuffing is
to be used the opening may be made
larger to suit the convenience of dressing.
When the gills and intestines have
been removed, the fish should be washed
freely in cold salted water, and all clotted
blood thoroughly removed. Only
under conditions hereinafter specified
should fish be washed after the fins have
been cut out or the solid flesh of the
fish has been cut into. No washing of
the flesh can make it any cleaner than
it is in its natural condition, and if the
fish is washed after the flesh has been
cut you are simply bringing the slime
and blood in contact with it, and the
more you wash it the more you are rubbing
it in, and the fish may become so
impregnated as to be extremely strong
when cooked. This is a point that
should not be disregarded if you would
have sweet-flavored fish. After washing
thoroughly, wipe perfectly dry, then
either cut out or trim off the fins, as
occasion requires or tastes suggest. A
pair of scissors will be found very convenient
for trimming off the fins.</p>
<p><span id="n4" class="ss">No. 4. To prepare Fish for Broiling.</span>&mdash;Dress,
wash and wipe dry before splitting.
Always split a fish on the under side,
and unless the fish is very small indeed
remove the back bone entire, then the
thickest part of the fish will come over
the center and hottest part of the fire,
and both sides will be cooked alike,
whereas if the back bone is left in one
side, that side will take longer to cook,
and will be less desirable after it is
cooked, for when the back bone is removed
from the cooked fish a good part
of the brown part is taken off with it,
and it loses its flavor as a broiled fish.
Properly broiled, all parts should be
equally browned, both an account of
flavor and appearance. Very small fish
are sometimes broiled without splitting;
these should be dressed the same as for
frying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p><span id="n5" class="ss">No. 5. To prepare Fish for Frying.</span>&mdash;Fish
may be fried whole in steaks or fillets.
Those to be fried whole must be dressed,
then washed and wiped perfectly
dry. Steaks are slices of fish cut crosswise;
fillets are made from steaks or
from pieces of fish cut off lengthwise,
and may be any size or shape to suit
individual tastes. The best way to make
fillets is to dress and split the fish, remove
the back bone and then cut the
fish into halves, quarters or eights, according
to size.</p>
<p><span id="n6" class="ss">No. 6. Fish to Skin.</span>&mdash;Fish that require
to be skinned before cooking, should
be first dressed and washed clean, then
remove the skin, head, tail and fins,
rinse quickly in clear cold water and
wipe thoroughly dry.</p>
<p>&#9758; <span class="ss">Notice.</span>&mdash;No repetition of the foregoing
directions for dressing and cleaning
fish will occur in connection with
any recipes to which they are applicable.
When other treatment is requisite
special directions will accompany the
recipe.</p>
<p><span id="n7" class="ss">No. 7. Fish Cookery in General.</span>&mdash;Under
this head will be found such instructions
for the cooking of fish as are applicable
to any or all kinds. Special
recipes for special varieties are given
elsewhere (see index) but many of these
are equally suited to other fish of similar
qualities.</p>
<p><span id="n8" class="ss">No. 8. Fish to Fry.</span>&mdash;Fish may be fried
in olive oil, pork fat, lard, cottolene, or
clarified drippings; the latter being
probably the most economical; the first
chiefly used in French or high-class
cookery, but we favor pork fat ourselves.
Whatever fat is used it should be deep
enough to cover the fish and hot enough
to brown a piece of bread handsomely
in thirty seconds or less. The pork fat
is made by trying out thin slices of fat
salt pork, being careful not to let it
burn. The pork gives the fish a flavor
not to be obtained by the use of salt in
connection with other oils or fats.
When the pork fat is used salt should
be used sparingly if at all. Fried fish
should be seasoned while cooking. The
slices of pork may be used as a garnish
and served with the fish. After wiping
dry, fish should be rolled in Indian
meal, flour, cornstarch, or crumbs before
frying. If the fish has been on ice
or is very cold, do not put it into the fat
fast enough to cool it perceptably.
Watch carefully while cooking, don&rsquo;t
break or mutilate in turning or dishing,
cook a nice brown, drain on a sieve, colander
or paper, and serve hot on a napkin.
Unless fish are very small they
should be notched each side before rolling
in meal or other absorbents previous
to frying.</p>
<p><span id="n9" class="ss">No. 9. To Saute</span>, is to fry in just fat
enough to cover bottom of frying pan.</p>
<p><span id="n10" class="ss">No. 10. To Broil.</span>&mdash;The process of broiling
is probably the most simple as well
as the most desirable method of cooking
many kinds of fish, the natural flavor
and juices being better preserved than
by any other, and the flavor may be further
enhanced by the judicious use of
seasoning, herbs, etc., preparatory to
broiling (see recipes for broiling.) The
double iron broiler is unquestionably
the best utensil for broiling fish, yet
they may be broiled on a griddle or in
a spider. Heat hot and butter well before
laying in the fish, cook the flesh
side first, when that is perfectly browned
turn and finish cooking. Serve on a
hot platter, spread with butter or cream
or both and season to taste. A fish may
also be broiled in a good hot oven in the
dripping pan, and if it be a very fat one
will cook nicely. The pan should be
well buttered and the fish placed skin
side down and cooked without turning.
Basting once or twice with butter or
cream while cooking is advisable.</p>
<p><span id="n11" class="ss">No. 11. To Boil.</span>&mdash;Boiling is considered
by many the most insipid and undesirable
way of cooking fish, yet there are
certain varieties that are best cooked
this way if accompanied by a rich sauce.
The fish boiler is almost indispensable
to success in boiling or steaming a whole
fish, but everybody hasn&rsquo;t one, and to
such we would say utilize the wash
boiler. Put a bowl or something in
each end that will support a platter,
either side up; on the platter lay the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
fish and add water enough to reach the
platter without coming in contact with
the fish, thus enabling you to steam the
fish, which is preferable to boiling. Fish
boiled in a common kettle should first
be wrapped closely in cheese cloth or
fine muslin to preserve its shape. The
head is the best part of a boiled fish,
and the nearer the head the better the
remaining portion. Boiled fish should
be served on a napkin and the sauce in
a tureen. A fish of six pounds should
boil or steam in thirty or thirty-five
minutes. The water should always be
salted. A boiled fish may be stuffed,
but usually they are not. Recipes for
sauces suitable for boiled fish will be
found under the head of sauces, (Nos.
<a href="#n13">13</a> to <a href="#n56">56</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n12" class="ss">No. 12. To Bake.</span>&mdash;Different varieties of
fish, different sizes, and different portions
of fish require such varied treatment
in baking we can offer but few
general rules for this branch of cookery.
Our recipes, however, will supply
all needed information. A dripping pan
with a false bottom, either wire or perforated,
with a handle at each end by
which to lift it, is particularly desirable
in baking fish. Wanting these, strips
of cloth well buttered and placed across
the bottom of the pan will be found extremely
convenient for lifting out the
fish. A baked fish presents a more attractive
appearance when served in an
upright position on the platter, and also
cooks much nicer in this condition. To
keep it so while cooking, first press it
down enough to flatten the under side,
then if necessary brace it up with skewers
or with potatoes placed against it
until it is well under way for cooking,
when it will keep its position until
cooked and dished. Sometimes it is advisable
to bend the fish half-moon shape
and cook it that way, or if the fish is
long and slender the tail may be tied to
the mouth, either of which methods will
keep the fish in upright position. Dressing
and force-meats are considered elsewhere,
and indexed under their appropriate
headings.</p>
<p>&#9758; The secret of success in all kinds
of fish cookery is to so cook and serve it
that it shall be attractive in appearance
and satisfying in flavor; that is, the flavor
when especially agreeable or desirable
must be retained or enhanced. When
the flavor of a fish is insipid or unpleasant
it must be cooked with a view to
imparting an unnatural but at the same
time pleasant flavor instead. This is
the secret of success in fish cookery, and
these points have been especially considered
in the selection of the accompanying
recipes.</p>
<p><span id="n13" class="ss">No. 13. Sauces.</span>&mdash;Sauces are extensively
used in all kinds of fish cookery.
For convenience in reference we have
given them first place among our recipes.
Although consommes or stocks are
not absolutely indispensable in connection
with fish cookery, they are nevertheless
extremely useful in the making
of nice sauces, and recipes for making
them in great variety may be found in
almost every cook book, still we have
thought best to give directions for making
two of those most frequently used
in preparing the following sauces.
When stocks are not at hand, liquor in
which fish have been cooked will answer
every purpose, and even milk or water,
or both may be substituted.</p>
<p><span id="n14" class="ss">No. 14. Consomme or White Stock.</span>&mdash;A
French method of making a white
stock, is to put in a stock pot, or kettle,
a roast fowl (chicken,) or the remains
of a chicken or turkey, a knuckle of
veal, say four pounds, one pound of
beef and three quarts of water, when
scum begins to rise skim carefully,
until it ceases to appear, then add a
carrot, a turnip, an onion, a leek, two
cloves, two stalks of celery, and a little
salt, simmer very gently four hours.
Remove every particle of grease and
strain through a flannel cloth, kept for
the purpose.</p>
<p><span id="n15" class="ss">No. 15. Fish Stock.</span>&mdash;Two pounds of
veal, four pounds of fish, or more veal,
and less fish, if you do not have as
much fish, two onions, rind of half a
lemon, bunch sweet herbs, two carrots,
two quarts water. Cut up fish and
meat and put with other ingredients into
the water, simmer two hours, skim
liquor carefully and strain. When a
richer stock is wanted, fry the vegetables
and fish before adding the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p><span id="n16" class="ss">No. 16. Drawn Butter.</span>&mdash;No. 1. This is
the simplest and most generally used
of any fish sauce, and serves as the
foundation for a large proportion of
such sauces. It can be made very economically
also, its cost depending upon
the amount of butter used. Simple as
it is many people fail in making it. To
make it nice and smooth with one pint
hot water, half a cup of butter, two
teaspoons flour, half a teaspoon salt
and half a saltspoon of pepper, put one-half
the butter in a saucepan and melt
without letting it brown, add the dry
flour, mixing well, then stir in the hot
water, a little at a time, stir rapidly as
it thickens; when perfectly smooth add
the remaining butter bit by bit and stir
until all absorbed, then add the seasoning;
if carefully made it will be free from
lumps, if it is not smooth strain before
serving.</p>
<p><span id="n17" class="ss">No. 17. Drawn Butter Sauce.</span>&mdash;No. 2.
Pour boiling hot drawn butter sauce
(<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>) into the well beaten yolks of
two eggs, mix thoroughly, season to
taste, and serve quickly.</p>
<p><span id="n18" class="ss">No. 18. Cream Sauce.</span>&mdash;This sauce is
made by substituting cream or milk for
water in the drawn butter sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n19" class="ss">No. 19. White or White Stock</span> (<a href="#n14">No. 14</a>)
substituted for the water in drawn butter
sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>) makes this sauce.</p>
<p><span id="n20" class="ss">No. 20. Acid Sauce.</span>&mdash;Lemon juice or
vinegar added to the drawn butter
sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n21" class="ss">No. 21. Anchovy Sauce.</span>&mdash;Bone four
anchovies and bruise in mortar to a
smooth paste and stir them in a drawn
butter sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>,) simmer five
minutes, or stir in two teaspoons of
essence of anchovy. A little cayenne
added is an improvement.</p>
<p><span id="n22" class="ss">No. 22. Egg Sauce.</span> To make this
sauce add two or three hard boiled eggs,
chopped or sliced, to the drawn butter
sauce (<a href="#n17">No. 17</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n23" class="ss">No. 23. Parsley Sauce.</span>&mdash;Add two teaspoons
of chopped parsley to the drawn
butter sauce (Nos. <a href="#n16">16</a> or <a href="#n17">17</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n24" class="ss">No. 24. Caper Sauce.</span>&mdash;Add capers to
suit to a plain drawn butter sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>,)
or to a White sauce (<a href="#n19">No. 19</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n25" class="ss">No. 25. Hollandaise Sauce.</span>&mdash;One cup of
butter, yolks of two eggs, juice of half
a lemon, one saltspoon of salt, pinch of
cayenne, half a cup of boiling water.
Rub butter to a cream, add yolks one at
a time, and beat well, adding lemon
juice, salt and pepper. A few minutes
before serving add the boiling water,
place the bowl in a saucepan of boiling
water, and stir rapidly until it thickens
like a boiled custard.</p>
<p><span id="n26" class="ss">No. 26. Wine Sauce.</span>&mdash;Mix and knead
well together in a bowl two ounces of butter,
one tablespoon of chopped parsley,
juice of one-half a lemon, salt and pepper,
speck of mace, and one wine glass
of Madeira or sherry wine. Beat the
butter to a cream and gradually beat in
the seasoning. A tablespoon of vinegar
may be substituted for the wine if preferred.
This sauce is particularly nice
for broiled fish. It should be poured
over the fish.</p>
<p><span id="n27" class="ss">No. 27. Cardinal Sauce.</span>&mdash;Cardinal sauce
is, as a rule, made from lobsters and
colored with coral; so, if possible, purchase
lobsters containing coral. Boil
the lobster; open and remove the coral
and press it through a sieve. Put two
tablespoonfuls of butter into a pan; let
it melt. Add a tablespoonful of flour
mixed, without browning; add one-half
pint stock, one-half teaspoonful of
onion juice, and a bay leaf. Stir constantly
until it boils. Take out the bay
leaf; add a palatable seasoning of salt
and pepper, the coral and a little of the
red part of the lobster chopped fine and
serve.</p>
<p><span id="n28" class="ss">No. 28. Sauce Soubise.</span>&mdash;Peel and chop
three onions; simmer them with one
ounce of butter for three quarters of an
hour, but do not let them color very
much. Add one tablespoon of flour, salt,
pepper and a pinch of mace, and mix
all together; moisten with half a pint
of the fish liquor, and the same quantity
of hot cream or milk. Serve in tureen.</p>
<p><span id="n29" class="ss">No. 29. Shrimp Sauce.</span>&mdash;Take half a pint
of drawn butter or white sauce
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
(<a href="#n19">No. 19</a>) and when boiling add a little
lobster coral, if you have it, if not, add
half a teaspoon of anchovy essence.
Remove the shells from four dozen
shrimp, put them into the sauce,
heat and serve. Canned shrimp may
be substituted for the fresh.</p>
<p><span id="n30" class="ss">No. 30. Lobster Sauce.</span>&mdash;Take the meat
from a boiled lobster weighing about
one pound, cut it into dice-shaped
pieces. Add two ounces of butter to
the coral, rub it together with the blade
of a knife, and press it through a
sieve. Make a butter sauce with cream,
put in the coral, season with salt, pepper
and a little mace, and heat it hot
without allowing to boil; add the
lobster meat, let it get hot again without
boiling, and serve in sauce tureen.
If allowed to boil it will spoil its color,
which is one desirable feature of this
sauce. Crab sauce may be made in the
same way, using lobster coral if convenient.</p>
<p><span id="n31" class="ss">No. 31. Bechamel Sauce.</span>&mdash;Mix dry in
saucepan one tablespoon of flour and two
ounces of butter, when well mixed add
one pint of milk, dissolve the flour paste,
set it on the fire and stir constantly;
when it gets thick remove from fire,
and add the yolk of one egg well
beaten. Add one teaspoon of water,
salt and pepper to taste, mix well and
it is ready for use. A bouquet of herbs
is an improvement to this sauce.</p>
<p><span id="n32" class="ss">No. 32. Maitre d&rsquo;Hotel Butter.</span>&mdash;Beat four
tablespoons of butter to a cream, beating
in gradually one tablespoon each of
vinegar and lemon juice, half a teaspoon
salt, quarter teaspoon pepper, and one
teaspoon chopped parsley.</p>
<p><span id="n33" class="ss">No. 33. Sauce a la Maitre d&rsquo;Hotel.</span>&mdash;Add
one teaspoon chopped parsley, juice of
one lemon, teaspoon of celery seed, cayenne,
and salt to taste to a drawn butter
sauce (<a href="#n16">No. 16</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n34" class="ss">No. 34. Sauce Allemande.</span>&mdash;Melt two oz.
butter and mix thoroughly with two

spices and acids. To four quarts

one chopped onion, two shallots,
two stalks of celery, three bay leaves,
one sliced carrot and six cloves, with

one quart of the water, and simmer all

Rub the fish well with salt, pepper and

<p><span id="n69" class="ss">No. 69. Fish a la Vinaigrette.</span>&mdash;(Serve
cold.) This may be made of fish cooked
expressly for the dish, or remnants of
almost any kind of cooked fish may be
used. The very best fish for the purpose
is the striped bass, for its flesh is
remarkably white, very firm, and possesses
a fine flavor. First stick the fish
with cloves, then boil it in vinegar and
water. Remove the skin and head, if
a whole fish, and set aside to cool.
When ready to serve, place it on a
napkin on a bed of crisp lettuce. Garnish
with sprigs of parsley, slices of
cucumber, water cresses, sliced lemon,
or boiled sliced beats, any of these are
suitable. Serve with a sauce tartare
(<a href="#n43">No. 43</a>.) If remnants of cooked fish
are used, they should be heaped in the
center of the dish and garnished same
as the whole fish, and the sauces may
be served separately, or poured over the
fish; if the latter way, it should not be
garnished until the same is poured over
it. A nice hot weather dish.</p>

<p><span id="n74" class="ss">No. 74. Fish Chowder.</span>&mdash;No fish chowder
should have bones in it; to avoid
this, dress, wash and cut up your fish
and put it on to boil in cold water,
without salt; as soon as it is cooked
enough&mdash;say ten minutes&mdash;for the flesh
to be separated from the bones, take it
up and remove all bones; put the head,
bones, etc., back into the water, and
boil until water is wanted. In the
meantime you should fry in the bottom
of your chowder kettle some small dice-shaped
pieces of salt pork, say one
quarter pound of pork for every five
pounds of fish; when the pork is all
tried out and nicely browned, but not
burnt, put in some thinly sliced onions
in quantity to suit, and cook these
until yellow, not brown; now put in
one quart of cold water (for five pounds
of fish,) strain the bone water and put
that in, then some sliced potatoes,
season with salt and pepper, and when
the potatoes are nearly done put in the
fish; boil one quart of milk and add to
the chowder; now try it and see if it is
seasoned all right; let all come to a
boil, pour into a tureen and serve. A
common way is to put a layer of crackers
on top of the chowder when the
milk is put in; but many prefer the
crackers served separately. Clam water
added to a fish chowder is a great improvement.</p>
<p><span id="n75" class="ss">No. 75. St. James Fish Chowder.</span>&mdash;Put
half pound sliced salt pork in bottom

three pounds of fish, cover with cold
water and bring to a boil gradually and
cook slowly for half an hour, then add
two pounds sea biscuit soaked for five
minutes in warm water, boil five minutes
more and serve immediately after
adding half a pint of port wine and a

<p><span id="n109" class="ss">No. 109. Fish Roes.</span>&mdash;Roes and spawns
are but different names given to the
eggs found in the female fish. The
male has a roe, usually called the milt,
but it is doubtful if it has any edible
value, though in some of the recipes of
old times we find it is occasionally utilized
in the making of sauces, dressing,
etc. The roe of the shad is now esteemed
a delicacy, though formerly considered
of little value. The haddock roe
ranks next in commercial importance,
but we believe there are others superior
to it if not equal to those of the shad.
Nearly all are eatable when in condition
and that of the striped bass is a favorite
with foreigners. As a rule the roe is in
best condition when the fish is most desirable
for the table. The shad is best
in the spring, the time varying with the
location when caught. Only the roe of
a perfectly fresh fish is really good.
Fish roes should be handled carefully
to keep from breaking. Soak in salted
water for a few minutes before cooking,
always wiping dry, if large they should
be parboiled before frying, and then if
very large split in two after parboiling.</p>
<p><span id="n110" class="ss">No. 110. Fish Roes to Fry.</span>&mdash;This is the
usual method of cooking, dipping the
roes in beaten egg and rolling in crumbs.
They should be well done, and require
considerable cooking. Unless perfectly

sputter badly. Drain each roe on paper
when taken up. Serve hot on a

and pepper to taste. Boil up again and

<p><span id="n123" class="ss">No. 123. Hustled Clams.</span>&mdash;This is the
plainest way of serving the long clam
and although a very inelegant dish is a
most palatable one, especially at the
seaside and in the camp. To a peck of
clams, after washing thoroughly, add
one gill of water, cover close and boil
until those on top are well opened, then
pour the contents of the kettle, water
and all, into a large pan and put it in
the centre of the table. Serve to each
person plain melted butter, to which
let each add, to suit, vinegar and pepper.
Take the clams in the fingers,
remove from the shell, pull off the
black skin that covers the snout and
runs around the clam, then take the
clam with the thumb and finger by the
snout, dip him in the butter, and eat
all but the black snout, which you will
bite off. Brownbread is a very appropriate
accompaniment, and is usually
served with baked clams at the famous
clam bakes, where the process of eating
is the same.</p>
<p><span id="n124" class="ss">No. 124. Clam Soup.</span>&mdash;For clam soups,
or chowders, it is better to open the
clams raw, but if too much trouble,
boil them enough to open the shells; in
either case save the liquor to put in the
soup. In what ever way clams are to
be cooked or eaten, the black skin that
covers the snout and surrounds the
clam must be discarded, as well as the
black part of the snout itself. Unless
the clams are very small it is better to
chop the hard parts before putting into
soups or chowders, the soft part may be
used whole. To make the soup, take
the liquor from one quart of clams and
put in double boiler with an equal quantity
of water, season with pepper and mace
and salt if needed; boil five minutes, put
in the clams, cover close, and boil from
five to fifteen minutes; the difference
depending upon whether the clams have
already been partially cooked; add one
pint of boiling milk, or more to suit,
thickened a little with flour and butter,
or fine cracker dust; butter some split
crackers and lay in bottom of tureen
and pour the soup over them. This
may be varied in many ways and the
quantity of milk used must depend upon
the amount of clam liquor available.
Chopped celery, or onion, or both,
improves the flavor for some people,
and some like a teaspoon of chopped
parsley.</p>
<p><span id="n125" class="ss">No. 125. Clam Chowder.</span>&mdash;There are
innumerable ways of making this
chowder, every cook book has one or
more recipes for it, yet, hardly any two
are alike. We give recipes for two
ways of making, which we do not think
can be improved upon. For the first
one open clams enough to make a quart
without the liquor, which you save
and strain for the chowder. Cut a
quarter pound of salt pork into small
dice shape pieces, put it into the bottom
of the kettle and fry brown, without
burning, adding, at the same time, four
sliced onions, or more, to suit; keep
stirring until the pork is all tried out
and the onions slightly colored. Then
add the clam water and an equal quantity
of fresh water, when it boils, add
six good sized potatoes, sliced very thin,
or chopped, cover close and cook until
the potatoes are done, have ready one
quart boiling milk and add with clams,
season with pepper, cover and cook,
until the clams are done, pour into
tureen and serve.</p>
<p><span id="n126" class="ss">No. 126. Clam Chowder No. 2.</span>&mdash;Take the
same quantity of clams as for the previous
chowder and prepare as for clam
soup. Put a layer of clams in the bottom
of kettle then a layer of hard crackers,
split, buttered and peppered, then
more clams and crackers until the clams
are all used, the top layer being crackers;
add clam liquor and water enough
to cover, cook slowly at first, then let
it boil briskly fifteen minutes if the
clams are raw. Have ready a pint of
boiling milk, add to the chowder, boil
up once. Sliced onions can be used in
this chowder, but should be boiled until
nearly done before adding them. Place
some of them on each layer of clams.
Sliced tomatoes may be used instead of
the crackers. Season to taste.</p>

and a speck of mace or nutmeg and add
the clams, simmer three minutes and
add one cup boiling cream. If the cream
is not boiled before adding it is liable to
curdle. A little clam water may be added,
also. Arrange split and buttered
crackers on a hot platter and pour the
creamed clams over them.</p>
<p><span id="n128" class="ss">No. 128. Steamed Clams.</span>&mdash;Steamed clams
are preferred to either boiled or baked
by some people. Wash the clams clean,
and pack them into a steamer edgewise
so the water will all drain off when they
cook, cover closely and steam until the
shells open well. Serve the clams in
the half shells after removing black
skin and cutting off the black end; scissors
are better than a knife for this purpose.
Serve melted butter and brownbread
with steamed clams. If it is desirable
to save the clam water, put the
clams into the kettle without any water.</p>
<p><span id="n129" class="ss">No. 129. Clam Water.</span>&mdash;Whenever clam
water is wanted for any purpose in
cooking it should be put into a pitcher
and allowed to stand until well settled,
then pour off carefully, if drained
through a sieve the small particles of
sand are liable to go through even the
finest of sieves.</p>
<p><span id="n130" class="ss">No. 130. Bisque of Clams.</span>&mdash;Boil one quart
of small clams out of the shell in their
own liquor for five minutes, then drain.
Put in saucepan, four oz. butter, with
two oz. flour, heat smooth and add the
clams and their liquor, a little salt,
pepper and a speck of cayenne, then
stir in one quart boiling milk, boil up
and serve.</p>
<p><span id="n131" class="ss">No. 131. Purce of Clams.</span>&mdash;A purce of
clams or other shell fish is made the same
as for a bisque, except that the clams
are rubbed through a sieve forming a
soft paste before adding the milk.</p>
<p><span id="n132" class="ss">No. 132. Scalloped Clams.</span>&mdash;Clams may
be scalloped same as oysters, but only
the soft parts should be used and those
should be boiled in the shell just
enough so they can be opened easily.
Some of the clam liquor should be used
to moisten the cracker crumbs.</p>
<p><span id="n133" class="ss">No. 133. Clam Croquettes.</span>&mdash;Chop the
boiled clams and mix with cracker
crumbs, moistening with clam liquor
and cream, seasoning to taste, form into
croquettes and fry in hot fat, or the
clams may be bruised to a paste. Drain
the croquettes on paper, or a sieve, and
serve on a napkin.</p>
<p><span id="n134" class="ss">No. 134. Clams au Gratin.</span>&mdash;Chop the
hard parts and mix with the soft. To a
cup of clams add a cup of bread or
cracker crumbs, add also one teaspoon
of finely chopped onion, half a teaspoon
of powdered marjoram and sage, the
same of chopped celery, a little cayenne
and salt if needed. Moisten with clam
liquor and boiled cream, put into baking
dish, sprinkle crumbs over the top, dot
with bits of butter and bake a nice
brown.</p>
<p><span id="n135" class="ss">No. 135. Clams a la Creole.</span>&mdash;Prepare
same as for au gratin and moisten with
canned tomatoes instead of the cream
and clam liquor. For either this dish,
or clams au gratin, if only the soft
parts of the clams are used they will be
found much nicer.</p>
<p><span id="n136" class="ss">No. 136. Clams on Toast.</span>&mdash;Open raw,
chop the hard parts and mix with the
soft, warm them up in their own liquor,
with butter, seasoning and a dash of
bruised mace. Have toast ready, either
bread or crackers, well buttered, strain
the liquor over the toast, then spread on
the clams. Serve hot. Cream, or wine,
or both, added to the liquor will be
found an improvement.</p>
<p><span id="n137" class="ss">No. 137. Fried Clams.</span>&mdash;Select good,
plump clams, dry them on a towel, roll
in cracker crumbs, dip in egg, again in
crumbs, and fry in hot fat; lay a sheet
of paper in a colander and put the
clams on this as fast as taken up; serve
them on a napkin on a hot platter.
The paper will prevent them from being
greasy when sent to the table.</p>
<p><span id="n138" class="ss">No. 138. Scalloped Clams.</span>&mdash;For this prepare
25 clams, one-half pint cracker
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
crumbs, one-half cup warm milk, one-fourth
cup of clam liquor, two beaten
eggs, one heaping teaspoonful melted
butter, salt and pepper, 12 clam shells;
season the clams highly; mix in another
dish crackers moistened first with milk,
then with the clam liquor; add eggs
and melted butter, and the clams chopped;
fill each clam shell heaping,
sprinkle with bread crumbs and brown.</p>
<p><span id="n139" class="ss">No. 139. Clam Fritters.</span>&mdash;Either whole
clams or chopped may be used. Prepare
a good batter, stir in the clams,
using considerable clam liquor in making
the batter. If whole clams are used
the large ones are the best, having one
in each fritter; when the chopped clams
are used the fritters may be made any
size to suit. Drain and serve on a
napkin. Parboil the clams before opening.</p>
<p><span id="n140" class="ss">No. 140. Soft Clams Stewed.</span>&mdash;Soft clams,
so called, are merely the soft parts used
without any of the hard parts (there are
no other soft clams.) To stew them
put the soft parts, raw, into saucepan
with a little butter, simmer a few minutes
and add boiling cream, with half
as much clam water, season with salt
and cayenne, add a little cracker dust,
simmer three minutes longer and serve.
As the clam water is always used to
increase the clam flavor, more or less
may be used to suit the taste.</p>
<p><span id="n141" class="ss">No. 141. Quahogs or Round Clams.</span>&mdash;These
require very much more cooking
than the long clam. Quahog shells, as
well as those of the sea clam, are very
useful for all kinds of shell fish scallops
and it is a good plan to keep them on
hand for this purpose.</p>
<p><span id="n142" class="ss">No. 142. Quahogs Raw.</span>&mdash;These are
highly esteemed by some people, the
medium size, or even quite small ones,
being preferable; they should be served
on the half shell, with vinegar, or lemon
juice and pepper, or with Worcestershire
sauce.</p>
<p><span id="n143" class="ss">No. 143. Quahog Cocktail.</span>&mdash;This is in
great favor at some of the New York
caf&eacute;s, though it is usually called a
&ldquo;clam cocktail.&rdquo; Take six of the
tiniest quahogs obtainable and put them
in a glass with a tablespoon of the clam
liquor, add a speck of cayenne, a saltspoon
of ground celery, a teaspoon of
tomato catsup, a teaspoon of vinegar
and one of Worcestershire sauce. Stir
thoroughly with a fork and eat one by
one. When the clams are gone, drink
the remaining contents of the glass.
Those who know, say this is delicious
beyond comparison.</p>
<p><span id="n144" class="ss">No. 144. Quahogs a la Provincetown.</span>&mdash;If
you want to eat clams of any kind
served to perfection go to Cape Cod.
Many people dislike the quahog
because they cannot cook it tender, but
they serve up a quahog stew in Provincetown
with the quahogs as tender as a
chicken. The quahogs are opened raw,
and with their liquor and some water
besides, are put on to cook immediately
after breakfast and at noontime they
are tender enough for anybody. After
coming to a boil they should merely
simmer until half an hour before serving,
when sliced potatoes are added and
they are allowed to cook faster until
these are done. No more liquid should
be used than just enough to keep the
stew from sticking; the only seasoning
used is pepper. Ten minutes before
taking up cover the top of the stew with
buttered crackers split in two. Pour
the entire contents of kettle on to a
platter and serve. The long clam is
also very good stewed in this way, but
the clams do not need to stew more
than half an hour before the potatoes
are put in. Try it and be convinced.</p>
<p><span id="n145" class="ss">No. 145. Quahog Chowder.</span>&mdash;This is
made the same as the clam chowder,
only the quahogs must be chopped very
fine, and must be put in at the same
time the potatoes are put in. Quahogs
may also be cooked in any way that the
long clam is cooked, remembering that
they must either be chopped very fine,
or be allowed more time in cooking.</p>
<p><span id="n146" class="ss">No. 146. Mussel Chowder.</span>&mdash;The mussels
that are found so plenty on some of our
beaches make a very nice <i>chowder</i>.
Select those that are fresh always, and
these can be easily distinguished by the
shells being tightly closed; if the shells
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
are open and remain so the mussel is
not fit to eat. Parboil them in the
shell, then open and remove the black,
mossy substance, the rest is eatable.
Cook the same as the long clam, they
are very tender and require but little
cooking.</p>
<p><span id="n147" class="ss">No. 147. Scallops.</span>&mdash;The shell of the
scallop is round and deeply grooved on
both sides.&mdash;from whence it takes its
name probably. The eatable part is
the muscle which unites the shell. The
dark colored rim should be discarded.
The scallop has a sweet flavor and is
so rich, however cooked, that the appetite
is soon cloyed. Scallops can be
stewed the same as oysters, or fried in
batter, or crumbs.</p>
<p><span id="n148" class="ss">No. 148. Scalloped Scallops.</span>&mdash;This is a
delicious dish. Take the scallops out
raw, discard the dark rim, cut the
scallops into small pieces and mix with
cracker crumbs, beaten egg and a little
milk or cream, seasoning to taste. Fill
some of the shells, washed for the purpose,
cover with crumbs, put a bit of
butter on each and bake a delicate
brown.</p>
<p><span id="n149" class="ss">No. 149. Scallop Fritters, or Fried in Crumbs.</span>&mdash;No
shell fish can surpass the
scallop. Fried in crumbs, or fried in
batter, it is fully equal to the oyster.</p>
<p><span id="n150" class="ss">No. 150. Seaside Scallop.</span>&mdash;This is a
great delicacy, and composed of equal
proportions of chopped lobster, crab,
oyster, clam and scallops. Mix all
together with cracker crumbs and
beaten egg, seasoning to taste, adding a
little chopped celery, chopped mushrooms
and parsley. Moisten with
cream and sherry wine equally; fill
clam shells; sprinkle crumbs on top,
with bits of butter; bake a delicate
brown and serve hot.</p>
<p><span id="n151" class="ss">No. 151. Crabs.</span>&mdash;There are three varieties
of crabs, all of which are highly
prized by the epicure. The large, blue
crab is eaten both hard and soft shell,
but the latter is esteemed the greater
delicacy. Oyster crabs have lately
taken their place among luncheon
dainties. These are all in the markets
the year round.</p>
<p><span id="n152" class="ss">No. 152. Boiled Crabs.</span>&mdash;Hard-shell crabs
require about fifteen minutes to boil,
and may be served plain, same as boiled
lobster, either hot or cold, all but the
spongy substance being eatable, but
the better way is to pick out the meat
and serve by some of the following
recipes:</p>
<p><span id="n153" class="ss">No. 153. Soft-Shell Crabs to Cook.</span>&mdash;These
are either fried or broiled whole. To
prepare them for cooking, lift the shell
at both edges and remove the gray,
spongy substance, which can be plainly
seen, then pull off the little triangular
apron like piece on under side of
shell, wash and wipe the crabs dry, dip
in milk and roll in flour and fry in
hot fat, five minutes ought to suffice; or
dip in beaten egg and roll in crumbs,
and either fry or broil.</p>
<p><span id="n154" class="ss">No. 154. Scalloped Crabs.</span>&mdash;No. 1. To
one pint boiled crab meat, picked fine,
add a little nutmeg, or mace, one tablespoon
cracker or bread crumbs, two
eggs well beaten and two tablespoons
butter; mix well, and fill the crab
shells, cleaned for the purpose, put
crumbs on top and a bit of butter for
each and put in the oven to brown.</p>
<p><span id="n155" class="ss">No. 155. Scalloped Crabs.</span>&mdash;No. 2. Pick
fine one pint boiled crab meat and mix
with a cream sauce (<a href="#n18">No. 18</a>,) salt and
pepper, fill the crab shells, cover with
buttered cracker crumbs and bake
brown.</p>
<p><span id="n156" class="ss">No. 156. Devilled Crabs.</span>&mdash;Mix one pint
chopped crab meat with the yolks of two
hard boiled eggs, chopped, one tablespoon
of bread crumbs, juice of half a
lemon, half a teaspoon prepared mustard,
a little cayenne, salt and one cup
drawn butter. When well mixed, fill
the crab shells, sprinkle crumbs over
the top, heat slightly and brown in
quick oven.</p>
<p><span id="n157" class="ss">No. 157. Crabs a la Creole.</span>&mdash;Put into
saucepan, one oz. of butter, one onion
chopped fine, and a little water, season
with salt, cayenne and mace; simmer
for fifteen minutes, add half a pint
strained tomato pulp, a gill of chicken
broth and a little celery salt. Cut six
soft-shelled crabs in halves, removing
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the spongy parts and put them into the
sauce; simmer eight minutes and serve.</p>
<p><span id="n158" class="ss">No. 158. Farcied Crabs.</span>&mdash;Remove meat
from four dozen boiled, hard-shell crabs
and chop fine. Put in a saucepan one
chopped onion and one oz. butter, when
beginning to color slightly add one
dozen chopped mushrooms and four oz.
bread crumbs, which have been previously
soaked in consomme (<a href="#n14">No. 14</a>)
and then press nearly dry, add salt,
pepper, cayenne and half a gill tomato
ketchup. Mix all well together while
heating and cook five minutes. Clean
the crab shells, fill with the mixture,
cover with crumbs and a little butter,
brown in oven a light color. Lobster
may be served in the same way.</p>
<p><span id="n159" class="ss">No. 159. Crab Saute.</span>&mdash;Soft-shell crabs
cut in two and all objectionable matter
removed may be sauted in butter or
salad oil, with a seasoning to suit. Canned
crab meat may be served in the
same way.</p>
<p><span id="n160" class="ss">No. 160. Crab Toast.</span>&mdash;Put one pint
boiled crab meat in saucepan, with
melted butter, one teaspoon chopped
celery, a pinch of flour, a gill of cream,
salt and pepper to taste; simmer until
reduced to suitable consistency for
spreading on thin slices of toast; garnish
with a few oyster crabs on each
slice. A dash of sherry is an improvement.
Lobster toast may be made in
same way.</p>
<p><span id="n161" class="ss">No. 161. Crab Bisque.</span>&mdash;Boil four hard-shelled
crabs in salted water for fifteen
minutes, wash and drain and pound in
a mortar; add one quart of white broth,
one bouquet of herbs, tablespoon of rice,
salt and pepper and boil three-quarters
of an hour; strain through a fine sieve,
add one cup of cream, heat without
boiling, and serve with small squares of
fried bread.</p>
<p><span id="n162" class="ss">No. 162. Lobster Bisque</span> may be made
same as crab, using canned lobster
meat, if more convenient.</p>
<p><span id="n163" class="ss">No. 163. Oyster Crabs.</span>&mdash;These may be
had of leading grocers. Heat them in
melted butter for a moment only, stir
carefully to keep them from sticking.
Butter split crackers, toast and butter
them and serve the crabs on them.</p>
<p><span id="n164" class="ss">No. 164. Crab Soup, Stuffed Crab</span> and
other dishes may be prepared same as
lobster.</p>
<p><span id="n165" class="ss">No. 165. Lobsters.</span>&mdash;Lobsters are in our
markets the year round, but are in best
condition during the late summer and
early autumn months. Canned lobsters
may be used in many made dishes.
The ordinary cook book contains all
needed information about boiling and
opening them; hence, for want of space,
we omit any directions of that kind, for
it is the purpose of this book to supply
information not to be found in the
ordinary cook book.</p>
<p><span id="n166" class="ss">No. 166. Boiled Lobster.</span>&mdash;Hot. (To
open and serve.) Plain lobster is usually
served cold, but it is delicious
served hot, although it does not present
a very attractive appearance when
served in this way, for to have it good
and hot it must be served in the shells.
Break off the claws and crack them;
separate the tail part from the body,
and if too large to serve in one piece,
cut the tail parts in pieces crosswise,
and split the body, removing the lady;
then the body may be quartered, but
without removing from the shell. In
this way each piece can be served in the
shell in a way that will admit of opening
with a knife and fork. Serve with
plain drawn butter only. Seasoning to
taste.</p>
<p><span id="n167" class="ss">No. 167. Lobster to Broil.</span>&mdash;Of late this
has been a very popular dish in the
lunch rooms of Boston. First split the
lobster lengthwise, which kills it at
once, discard the lady and the dark
vein, brush a little melted butter over
the open sides and broil over a clear
fire, first the shell side, then the other.
Serve with melted butter.</p>
<p><span id="n168" class="ss">No. 168. Lobster to Bake Whole.</span>&mdash;Split,
as for broiling, place the parts in pan
open side up, sprinkle lightly with
bread crumbs moistened with butter
and bake twenty to thirty minutes in
quick oven. The claws may be cracked
and baked at the same time. Serve
with melted butter, or a sauce, if preferred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p><span id="n169" class="ss">No. 169. Lobster Soup.</span>&mdash;Chop one
pound of boiled lobster meat&mdash;canned

double boiler, one quart each, milk and
water, when it comes to a boil, stir in
two tablespoons flour and add the chopped
lobster, with pepper, salt and the
faintest suspicion of mace, let it boil up
once, add a small piece of butter, pour
into tureen and serve hot.</p>
<p><span id="n170" class="ss">No. 170. Lobster Chowder.</span>&mdash;Chop one
pound boiled lobster meat&mdash;canned will
do&mdash;rather course. Boil one quart of
milk and stir in four pounded or rolled
crackers, then add the lobster. Season
with salt and pepper, boil up once and
serve. One small onion may be boiled,
chopped and added with the lobster, if
liked, but it is rich enough without.</p>
<p><span id="n171" class="ss">No. 171. Astor House Lobster.</span>&mdash;Take
two live lobsters of a pound and a half

immediately.</p>
<p><span id="n173" class="ss">No. 173. Lobster a la Francaise.</span>&mdash;Remove
the meat from a freshly boiled
lobster and cut into small pieces about
one inch square; pound the yolks of
three hard-boiled eggs, mix with them
half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of

thoroughly, and add slowly four tablespoons
of melted butter and four tablespoons
vinegar; pile the lobster high in
the center of a dish, pour the sauce
over it, and sprinkle over the whole,
parsley and lobster coral; garnish the
edge of the dish with crisp yellow

<p><span id="n174" class="ss">No. 174. Lobster Cutlets.</span>&mdash;Pick the meat
from a large lobster and two small

mace, a little nutmeg and cayenne pepper;
add the yolks of two well beaten
eggs, the white of one and a spoonful of
anchovy sauce; mix the above thoroughly
and roll it out as you would pastry,
with a little flour, nearly two inches
thick; cut it into cutlets, brush them
over with the yolk of egg, dip them
into bread crumbs and fry a nice brown
in butter, a spoonful of anchovy sauce
and the remainder of coral; pour it into

<p><span id="n175" class="ss">No. 175. Stuffed Lobster.</span>&mdash;Cut one pint
boiled lobster meat into small dice shape
pieces, season and mix with one
cup cream and a few cracker crumbs,
adding also the lobster butter. Clean
the tail shells of the lobsters and fill
with the mixture, cover with cracker
crumbs, moisten with melted butter
and bake until the crumbs are brown.
Beaten egg may be mixed with the
lobster, if it is desirable to make it
richer, and using half wine and half
cream makes it a yet more delicious
dish.</p>
<p><span id="n176" class="ss">No. 176. Devilled Lobster.</span>&mdash;Cut rather
fine one pound of boiled lobster meat

one pint oysters moderately fine, season
with salt, pepper and a suspicion of
mace, and put them into saucepan with
melted butter. Beat the yolks of two
eggs with one gill rich cream, stir in
with the oysters until they begin to
harden, then pour over buttered toast
and serve.</p>
<p><span id="n186" class="ss">No. 186. Oysters, to Parboil or Blanch.</span>&mdash;Put
them on to boil without any liquor, as
enough comes from the oyster, stir or
shake in a saucepan slightly at first,
when the edges begin to wrinkle and
the oyster looks plump they are ready
for sauces and other ways of cooking, in
some of which it will be noted they have
to be bearded, that is, the black edges
trimmed off.</p>
<p><span id="n187" class="ss">No. 187. Oyster Soup.</span>&mdash;Strain the liquor
from one quart of oysters and add as
much water as you have oyster liquor,
and put it on to boil, skim and add the
oysters and let them simmer without
boiling until they begin to grow plump
and the edges to wrinkle, strain out the
oysters and add to the liquor one pint
of boiling milk thickened with a tablespoon
of butter and two of flour seasoned
to taste, boil five minutes, add the
oysters, which have been kept hot, and
serve.</p>

is a very common dish and a simple one
to prepare, many people fail in their attempt
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
to make it. Boil one quart of
milk in double boiler, add one pint solid
oysters, butter, salt and white pepper to
taste; when the oysters begin to wrinkle
serve. Some prefer to add the butter
just before taking up. The stew may
be poured over common crackers split,
buttered and peppered, or served plain
with oyster crackers, separately.</p>
<p><span id="n189" class="ss">No. 189. Oysters a la Newport.</span>&mdash;Put one

one pint solid oysters, a tablespoon of
chopped celery, salt and white pepper
to taste, cover and simmer three minutes,
add a wineglass of sherry and a
wineglass of cream, simmer a couple of
minutes longer and serve on toast.
Mushrooms instead of the celery also
make a delicious dish.</p>
<p><span id="n190" class="ss">No. 190. Oyster Fritters, or Oysters Fried in Batter.</span>&mdash;For
this dish the oysters may be
used whole or chopped. The batter

Drain the fritters on paper as fast
as taken up, and serve, on a napkin,
garnished with parsley.</p>
<p><span id="n191" class="ss">No. 191. Oysters au Gratin.</span>&mdash;Parboil one
pint small oysters, or if large cut in
halves or quarters, then drain; add
yolks of two eggs well mixed in a little
milk, to half a pint boiling cream, season
with salt, pepper, and a little mace;
when beginning to boil add the oysters,
and mix all well together. Have some
large, smooth oyster shells all cleaned,
and fill them with the mixture, cover
lightly with bread crumbs and melted
butter on top, bake until brown.</p>
<p><span id="n192" class="ss">No. 192. Scalloped Oysters.</span>&mdash;This is a
most popular dish, but the number of
cooks that don&rsquo;t know how to make it
properly is wonderful to contemplate.
The following directions, strictly adhered
to, cannot fail to produce satisfactory
results: For one quart of solid
oysters use one pint of pounded cracker
crumbs, three oz. of butter, one gill of
cream, half a gill of oyster liquor, pepper
and salt to taste, and a suspicion of
mace. Butter the baking dish and cover
the bottom thickly with the pounded
cracker, wet with oyster liquor and a
little cream, then add a single layer of
oysters, salt and pepper and a bit of
butter on each oyster, then more
crumbs, oysters and so on, until the
dish is full, the top layer being crumbs,
dotted over with bits of butter. Set in
the oven with a plate or other cover
and bake until the juice bubbles up to
the top, then remove the cover and
pour over the whole one glass of sherry
or Maderia wine and return to the oven
to brown slightly. The wine may be
omitted if objectionable, but we know
of no dish where a glass of wine so
enhances its flavor.</p>
<p><span id="n193" class="ss">No. 193. Oyster Pie.</span>&mdash;Line a deep dish
with a good puff paste, not too rich,
roll out upper crust and lay on plate,
just the size of pie dish, set it on top of
the dish and put it into the oven, as the
crust must be nearly cooked before the
oysters are put in, for they require less
cooking than the crust. While the
crust is baking strain the liquor from
the oysters and thicken with yolks of
eggs boiled hard and grated (three eggs
for one quart of oysters) add two tablespoons
butter and the same of cracker
crumbs, season with salt, pepper and
nutmeg or mace. Let the liquor just
boil, slip in the oysters, let it boil up
once, then stir, remove plate with the
crust, pour the oysters and hot liquor
into the pie dish, put the top crust on
and return to oven for five minutes.</p>
<p><span id="n194" class="ss">No. 194. Oyster Patties.</span>&mdash;Cut one quart

one cup rich drawn butter based on
milk, season to taste, cook five minutes,
fill the patty cases, heat two minutes

<p><span id="n195" class="ss">No. 195. Oyster Croquettes.</span>&mdash;Parboil
one pint of oysters, drain and chop,
moisten with a thick cream sauce and the
oyster liquor, add one teaspoon chopped
parsley and bread or cracker crumbs
sufficient to make the mixture firm
enough to shape, season with salt, pepper
and a little onion juice. Let the
mixture get cold, then shape into
croquettes and fry in hot fat in a frying
basket if you have it, drain and serve

thick, then add one pint of oil, beginning
with a few drops at a time. When
the dressing is quite hard add two table
spoons of vinegar and the juice of one
lemon, beating all the while; if too
thick add more vinegar. When of right
consistency set away to keep cool, and do
not pour over the lobster until just before

<p><span id="n210" class="ss">No. 210. Eels to Broil.</span>&mdash;We know of no
better way to cook this often despised
but really delicious fish, and although
it need not necessarily be skinned for
that purpose, we much prefer it in that

to bring out its delicate flavor. Large
eels are always the best, and particularly
so for broiling.</p>

<p><span id="n219" class="ss">No. 219. Carp to Cook.</span>&mdash;This fish has
recently been naturalized in American
waters and should in time become abundant
and cheap, from the fact that it
multiplys rapidly, acquires a large size
and flourishes in waters where other
fish would speedily become extinct.
The scales are said to be eatable, and in
cleaning the fish these should not be
removed, but the fish should be scoured
in salted water. There seems to be a
diversity of opinion concerning its
flavor, but in the report of the U. S. Fish
Commission we find it highly praised.
The better way to cook this fish is to boil
or bake, and the same recipes given for
bass, sheepshead, or similar fish, are

the fish in kettle with one sliced carrot,
one sliced onion, three cloves of garlic,
six bay leaves, six cloves, six branches
thyme, four parsley roots, and cover
the fish with half a bottle white wine
and one quart consomme (<a href="#n14">No. 14</a>,) when
it comes to a boil remove the fish to
baking pan and cook slowly for one
hour, basting freely with the liquor in
which it was boiled. Serve with a sauce
made from the gravy, adding capers,
thickening and seasoning to taste.
Striped bass, deep sea flounders and
other coarse-meated fish may be cooked
by the recipes given for cooking the
ray.</p>
<p><span id="n238" class="ss">No. 238. Salmon Cutlets, Herb Sauce.</span>&mdash;Cut
the salmon in slices an inch thick
and about three inches square, or of a
diamond shape. Chop fine half a dozen
button onions, a little parsley and
thyme, add pepper, salt and a dash of
mace or nutmeg. Put these ingredients
in saucepan with a little water and a
glass of wine; heat for about five minutes.
Put all in a suitable dish for
baking, on top put the cutlets, cover
and bake half an hour, basting freely
from time to time with the liquid.
When done, arrange the fish on a hot
platter, add another glass of wine to the
gravy, with the juice of a lemon and
pour all over the fish and serve. Half
a dozen mushrooms chopped and put in
with the herbs will be found an improvement.</p>
<p><span id="n239" class="ss">No. 239. Trout Baked, Herb Sauce.</span>&mdash;Clean,
wash and dry six trout of about
one quarter pound each. Place them
on a buttered dish, adding half a glass
of white wine and one finely chopped
shallot. Cook ten minutes, then put
the gravy in a saucepan with tablespoon
of cooked herbs, moistening with half a
pint of sauce allemande (<a href="#n34">No. 34</a>.) Reduce
gravy one half and pour it over
the trout with the juice of half a lemon
and serve.</p>
<p><span id="n240" class="ss">No. 240. Baked Salmon Trout with Cream Gravy.</span>&mdash;Wipe
dry and lay in pan with
just enough water to keep from scorching.
If large, score the back, but not
the sides, bake slowly from three quarters
to one hour, basting with butter and
water. Into a cup of rich cream stir
three or four tablespoons boiling water
(or cream will clot when heated,) into
this stir gently two tablespoons melted
butter and a little chopped parsley.
Put this into milk boiler or farina
kettle, or any vessel you can set into
another, half filled with boiling water
to prevent sauce from burning; add the
cream and butter to the gravy from the
dripping pan in which fish was baked;
lay the trout on a hot platter and let
the gravy boil up once, then pour over
the fish; garnish with sprigs of parsley.
Use no spiced sauces and very little
salt. This creamed gravy may be used
for various kinds of boiled and baked
fish.</p>
<p><span id="n241" class="ss">No. 241. Baked Shad.</span>&mdash;Stuff with
dressing (<a href="#n84">No. 84</a>,) rub the fish well with
flour, lay in pan with a very few thin
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
slices of pork on top. Bake a medium
size fish forty minutes, add a little hot
water, butter, pepper and salt to the
gravy; boil up and serve in gravy tureen.
Garnish the fish with sprigs of
parsley. A tablespoon of anchovy
sauce, or a glass of wine, is a decided
improvement in making the gravy.</p>
<p><span id="n242" class="ss">No. 242. Fillets of Shad with Mushrooms.</span>&mdash;Prepare
the fillets in the usual way,
cutting in equal size and shape; put
them on a plate, skin side down, and
sprinkle each with a little salt, pepper,
lemon juice and chopped parsley; let
them remain in this condition fifteen
minutes, then put them into a saucepan
with a glass of white wine and an
oz. of butter. Have ready a few stewed
mushrooms, and when the fish are done
remove them to a hot platter; put the
mushrooms into the fish gravy, add
another glass of wine and a wineglass
of cream, simmer a minute and pour over
the fish. If this doesn&rsquo;t go to the right
spot there is something the matter with
the fish, the mushrooms, or the one who
partakes of it.</p>
<p><span id="n243" class="ss">No. 243. Baked Tautog, or Black Fish.</span>&mdash;The
tautog is a very nice fish. It is in
best condition in the fall, but it is good
at all times. In New York markets it
is best known as the black fish. About
Buzzard&rsquo;s Bay and Vineyard Sound,
where it is very plenty, it is generally
called tautog. It is a difficult fish to scale,
but the operation is made easier by
pouring boiling water over it, but it
must not soak in the hot water for an
instant. It may be skinned for baking,
in which case it is better to cover it
with a buttered paper while baking,
removing the paper in time to brown
the fish before taking from the oven.
The fish should be scored before baking
and narrow strips of fat pork inserted
in the gashes made. In May and June
always save the roe to this fish&mdash;it may
be baked with the fish, or fried separately&mdash;it
is too good to be wasted.
Make a dressing as for any fish, and
prepare the gravy in the usual way.</p>
<p><span id="n244" class="ss">No. 244. Salmon.</span>&mdash;The ordinary cook
book is full pf recipes for cooking this
king of fishes, hence we have given it less
attention than those varieties neglected
by these books. There is no better way
to cook this delicious fish than to boil,
and it should be served with a simple
sauce. Some of the recipes for turbot,
trout or sole may be used for cooking
salmon. That for salmon trout (<a href="#n240">No. 240</a>)
will be found just the thing for the
land locked salmon.</p>
<p><span id="n245" class="ss">No. 245. Sheepshead a la Creole.</span>&mdash;The
sheepshead is one of the best of our saltwater
fishes; it is not so plenty as formerly,
but some seasons it is quite
plenty in our markets. To cook, put
one chopped onion and one chopped
green pepper (seed extracted) in a stewpan,
and brown in half a gill of oil for
five minutes; add one tomato sliced,
four sliced mushrooms, a good bouquet
of herbs and a clove of garlic; season
with salt and pepper and moisten with
half a pint of sauce allemande. Cut
three pounds of fish into slices, lay
them flat in the stewpan with three tablespoons
of mushroom liquor, and cook
for one hour on a slow fire. When
ready to serve, sprinkle over with a
tablespoon of chopped parsley and
decorate with six heart-shaped croutons.</p>
<p><span id="n246" class="ss">No. 246. Trout a la Chambord.</span>&mdash;Make a
forcemeat with one pound of firm, fresh
fish, remove the skin and bones, pound
well in a mortar, adding the whites of
three eggs, a little at a time; when well
pounded add half a pint of cream, half
a teaspoon of salt and a little white
pepper and nutmeg; mix well and use
a portion of it for stuffing three trout of
half a pound each; butter well a deep
baking dish and lay in the trout, add
half a glass of white wine, a bouquet of
herbs, salt and pepper; bake fifteen
minutes, basting often; take up the fish
and put them on a dish to keep hot,
remove the gravy to a saucepan, add
one truffle and four mushrooms, sliced,
(take out the bouquet) also a glass of
wine; heat hot and pour over the fish,
decorate with six quenelles made from
the remaining forcemeat.</p>
<p><span id="n247" class="ss">No. 247. Sturgeon Roasted.</span>&mdash;Take a
piece of fish that is adapted to stuffing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
make a dressing (<a href="#n89">No. 89</a>.) Rub well
inside and out with salt, butter and
pepper; stuff and sew up, or bind firmly,
and lay in baking pan with a very little
water, cover with paper until nearly
done, then remove paper and sprinkle a
few bread crumbs over the fish and let it
brown nicely. Serve with plain butter
and flour added to the fish gravy. If you
have a piece to roast that will not
admit of stuffing, prepare some forcemeat
balls (<a href="#n89">No. 89</a>) and bake beside the
fish. Some cook books recommend removing
the back bone and inserting the
dressing in the space thus obtained, but
as the sturgeon has no bones whatever,
this might prove a difficult thing to do.</p>
<p><span id="n248" class="ss">No. 248. Brochet of Smelts.</span>&mdash;Spread melted
butter in bottom of shallow baking
dish, dredge with raspings of bread,
season with salt, pepper, chopped parsley
and shallots; put in a laying of fish
and pour over it a glass of wine and a
teaspoon of anchovy sauce; cover with
melted butter and bread raspings, and
bake in oven fifteen minutes. Serve
hot; arrange the fish on a napkin, heads
to heads, in center of dish, or lay them
all one way in rows, each row overlapping
the next about two thirds the
length of fish. Garnish with quartered
lemon and fried parsley.</p>
<p><span id="n249" class="ss">No. 249. Trout a la Genevoise.</span>&mdash;Cut the
heads off four little trout and put the
fish in an earthen pot for four hours,
with a little thyme, four bay leaves,
two shallots cut in pieces, five branches
of parsley, little pepper and salt and
the juice of two lemons; then take out
the fish and put them in a saucepan
with a chopped onion, a clove of garlic
and enough red wine to cover the fish;
boil gently for twenty minutes; then
strain the liquid in stone pot and add
one half of it to half a pint of Spanish
sauce (<a href="#n37">No. 37</a>) and boil for one hour;
then add four chopped mushrooms and
truffles and a little parsley. Dish the
trout, garnish with parsley and serve
the sauce separately.</p>
<p><span id="n250" class="ss">No. 250. Stewed Trout.</span>&mdash;Take two
trout of a pound each and lay them in
a saucepan with half an onion sliced
thin, a little chopped parsley, two
cloves, one blade of mace, two bay
leaves, a little thyme, salt and pepper,
one pint white stock (<a href="#n14">No. 14</a>) and wineglass
port wine; simmer gently half an
hour, or more, if not quite done. Dish
the trout, strain the gravy, thicken
with butter and flour, stirring over sharp
fire five minutes, pour over fish and
serve.</p>
<p><span id="n251" class="ss">No. 251. Brook Trout.</span>&mdash;Put a trout of
four pounds in fish kettle with four oz.
of salt; when beginning to boil, set the
kettle on the back of the range for
twenty-five minutes. Parboil the roes
of a shad in salted water, drain and cut
them in small pieces, and also a dozen
mushrooms, add these with the juice of
a lemon to one pint of sauce allemande
(<a href="#n34">No. 34</a>) and boil ten minutes. Serve
the fish garnished with sprigs of parsley
and the sauce in a tureen.</p>
<p><span id="n252" class="ss">No. 252. Scallops of Trout.</span>&mdash;Take a
medium size trout and cut into slices
one inch thick, put into a saucepan with
a little melted butter, add salt, white
pepper and the juice of a lemon; when
done on one side, turn and cook the
other. Mash some boiled potatoes and
with them form a border on a platter
that can go to the oven; moisten the
potatoes lightly with melted butter and
brown in the oven; when done arrange
the scallops in the center of the potato
border and pour over it a sauce bechamel
(<a href="#n31">No. 31</a>.)</p>
<p><span id="n253" class="ss">No. 253. Boiled Turbot.</span>&mdash;Soak the fish
first in salted water to take off slime, do
not cut off fins; when clean make
an incision down the middle of the back
to prevent skin on the other side from
cracking, rub it over with lemon and
lay it in kettle of cold water; after it
gets to boiling let it boil slowly; when
done, drain well and lay on hot
napkin; rub a little lobster coral
through a sieve, sprinkle it over fish
and garnish with sprigs of parsley and
sliced lemon. Serve with lobster (<a href="#n30">No. 30</a>)
or shrimp sauce, or with plain drawn
butter. The old fashioned way of dishing
this fish is white side up, but now
usually the dark side up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p><span class="ss">1. Fish Balls.</span>&mdash;3 pints of potatoes
(measured after being pared and cut into
pieces), 1 package of Favorite brand
Picked codfish, 1 small onion (cut into
pieces), 1 tablespoonful of butter, 1 large
or two small eggs. Boil the potatoes and
onion until soft, drain off all the water
and mash until free from lumps. Turn
the fish into a napkin and pour through
it about one pint of cold water and
squeeze. Mix with the potato, using a
fork as it makes it lighter, add the butter
and the beaten egg; now taste and if not
salt enough add a little. Take up by
the spoonful and drop into deep fat which
is hot enough to brown a piece of bread
in 40 seconds, fry until a golden brown
(about 1 minute,) drain on soft paper.
This makes twenty medium size fish
balls. The onion can be omitted if the
flavor is not liked.</p>
<p><span class="ss">2. Fish Balls.</span>&mdash;Take one pint bowl of
Diamond Wedge brand codfish picked
very fine, 2 pint bowls whole raw potatoes
sliced thickly, put them together in
plenty of cold water and boil until potatoes
are thoroughly cooked; remove
from the fire and drain off all the water,
mash them with a potato masher, add
piece of butter size of an egg, one well
beaten egg, and three teaspoonfuls of
cream or rich milk. Flour your hands
and make into balls or cakes. Put an
ounce of butter and lard into a frying
pan, when hot put in the balls and fry a
nice brown. Do not freshen the fish before
boiling with the potatoes. Many
cooks fry them in a quantity of lard
similar to boiled doughnuts.</p>
<p><span class="ss">3. &ldquo;Diamond Wedge&rdquo; Fish Balls.</span>&mdash;One
pint of raw potatoes, cut in pieces;
one cup of &ldquo;Diamond Wedge&rdquo; Codfish.
Boil together until potatoes are tender,
then draw off the water and mash, beating
well together; add one tablespoonful
of butter, one egg and a little pepper.
Shape into small balls and fry in hot
lard.</p>
<p><span class="ss">4. Fish Balls.</span>&mdash;To one-half pound
package &ldquo;Gold Wedge Brand&rdquo; Fibered
Codfish add double quantity mashed
potatoes. Saturate the codfish with cold
water slightly, and strain through a cloth
(requires no soaking.) Mix thoroughly
with the potatoes; add one tablespoonful
of butter and a little pepper. Shape into
small balls and fry in hot lard.</p>
<p>The addition of an
egg to the above receipt improves it very
much.</p>
<p><span class="ss">For Creamed Codfish.</span>&mdash;Saturate as
above; to a gill or cup of fish add two of
milk and one tablespoonful of butter.
Let it come to a boil; then add one teaspoonful
cornstarch and one egg well
beaten. Served on toast it makes a
delicious dish.</p>
<p><span class="ss">Fish Sauce.</span>&mdash;Rub smooth 2 tablespoons
of butter with 1 of flour, stir into
a pint of boiling milk, let it simmer a
few minutes; have ready in the sauce
dish a hard boiled egg, cut fine; pour the
sauce over it.</p>
<p><span class="ss">A Nice Relish for Breakfast or Tea,
Broiled Smoked Halibut.</span>&mdash;Remove the
skin and soak over night with the skin
side downward. Broil and garnish with
butter and serve hot.</p>
<p><span class="ss">Stewed Codfish (Salt).</span>&mdash;Take a thick
white piece of Diamond Wedge salt codfish,
lay it in cold water for a few minutes
to soften it a little, enough to make it
more easily to be picked up. Shred it in
very small bits, put it over the fire in a
stewpan with cold water; let it come to
a boil, turn off this water carefully, and
add a pint of milk to the fish, or more
according to quantity. Set it over the
fire again and let it boil slowly about
three minutes, now add a good sized
piece of butter, a shake of pepper and a
thickening of a tablespoonful of flour in
enough cold milk to make a cream.
Stew five minutes longer, and just before
serving stir in two well beaten eggs. The
eggs are an addition that can be dispensed
with, however, as it is very good
without them. An excellent breakfast
dish.</p>
<p><span class="ss">Codfish a la Mode.</span>&mdash;Pick up a teacup
full of Diamond Wedge salt codfish
very fine, and freshen&mdash;the dessicated is
nice to use; two cups of mashed potatoes,
one pint cream or milk, two well beaten
eggs, half cup of butter, salt and pepper;
mix, bake in an earthen baking dish
from twenty to twenty-five minutes;
serve in the same dish placed on a small
platter, covered with a napkin.</p>
<p><span class="ss">Fillet of Sole Baked.</span>&mdash;Cut a fish
of four pounds into fillets, about
five inches long by four inches wide,
each end tapering to a point. Put these
in buttered pan, cover with sauce allemande
(<a href="#n34">No. 34</a>) and sprinkle with bread
crumbs and dot with bits of butter.
Bake until well browned. Add a wine
glass of sherry to half a pint of sauce
allemande, boil ten minutes and pour
around the fish and serve.</p>
<p><span class="ss">For Escalloped Codfish.</span>&mdash;Freshen
one-half pound package of Shute &amp; Merchant&rsquo;s
Fibered Codfish by soaking three
minutes in cold water, then add one pint

butter and four eggs, beaten light. Season
to taste, bake until brown, serve hot.</p>

<p class="t0">Who at good fortune had taken their turn;</p>

<p>1st. It needs no cooking, thus doing away with the odor which
usually comes from the ordinary salt codfish.</p>
<p>2nd. It is fibered by a machine (of our own make) which preserves
all of the original flavor and fibre of the codfish.</p>
<p>3rd. A pound package of FIBERED CODFISH is equal to two
pounds of ordinary salt codfish, and it can be made ready in ten minutes
time.</p>
<p>4th. FIBERED CODFISH makes the finest codfish balls and
creamed codfish of anything in the market. A trial package will convince
the most skeptical.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
